## Features

### 1. **User Authentication**

* **Registration and Login**: Users can sign up and log in to access personalized features.
* **Session Management**: Secure login with session-based authentication, ensuring the user's data is kept private.

### 2. **Dynamic Dashboard**

* **Overview Page**: A clean, modern UI showing all key greenhouse metrics at a glance, including temperature, humidity, and lighting conditions.
* **Visual Data Representation**: Real-time graphs and charts to monitor greenhouse conditions.

### 3. **Crop Yield Prediction**

* **Predict Yield**: Users can input greenhouse parameters (temperature, humidity, lighting conditions, etc.) and receive predictions about the total crop yield and yield per plant.
* **Stage-Specific Data**: The system accounts for different crop growth stages (germination, vegetative, flowering, and fruiting) and adjusts for each stageâ€™s environmental needs.

### 4. **Plant Disease Detection**

* **Image-Based Detection**: Users can upload plant images, and the system will analyze them for signs of disease using advanced machine learning techniques.
* **Fast and Accurate**: The disease detection process is optimized for quick feedback and accuracy.

### 5. **Lighting Control System**

* **Advanced LED Control**: The system uses ESP32 to control the RGB LED light intensity (red, green, blue) for specific growth stages.
* **Energy-Efficient**: Only the necessary light colors are activated, ensuring optimal plant growth while minimizing energy usage.
* **ESP32 Integration**: The backend communicates with the ESP32 to send light intensity values (RGB) based on the plant's current growth stage.

### 6. **Maintenance Prediction**

* **Equipment Health**: The system predicts whether maintenance is needed for equipment based on usage and performance metrics.
* **Risk Level and Recommendations**: It provides maintenance risk levels and recommended dates for service.

### 7. **Smart Greenhouse Configuration**

* **Zone-Based Crop Configuration**: Users can configure specific crops per zone within the greenhouse, ensuring proper management and optimized growing conditions.
* **Temperature and Humidity Settings**: Environmental settings can be customized for different zones and growth stages, ensuring plants get the ideal conditions.

### 8. **Data Management and History Tracking**

* **Store Data**: All interactions, including crop yields, disease detection results, and maintenance logs, are saved in the database for easy retrieval.
* **History Tracking**: Users can view past predictions and disease detection results.
* **Reports**: The system generates downloadable PDF reports with detailed information about predictions and analysis.

### 9. **Schemes Page**

* **View Schemes**: Scheme data is dynamically loaded from a `schemes.json` file, providing users with relevant farming schemes.
* **Responsive Design**: The schemes page follows the same theme and design style as the rest of the dashboard, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

### 10. **Marketplace**
* **Buy and Sell Crops & Equipment**: A built-in marketplace where users can buy and sell agricultural products like seeds, fertilizers, tools, and crops.

* **Product Listings**: Detailed descriptions, prices, and images for each product.

* **Buyer & Seller Profiles**: Users can create profiles, manage product listings, and communicate directly with buyers or sellers.

* **Secure Transactions**: Enables secure payment processing and order tracking.

* **Ratings & Reviews**: Buyers can rate products and leave reviews to help others in the community.

* **Inventory Management**: Sellers can track their stock in real time and manage product availability.
## Technology Stack

* **Flask**: Python-based web framework for backend development.
* **SQLite**: Database for storing user data, crop predictions, and history tracking.
* **TailwindCSS**: Modern CSS framework used for the frontend UI design.
* **FastAPI**: Used for model inference (plant disease detection, yield prediction).
* **ESP32**: Used for the lighting control system to manage the RGB LED intensity.
* **OpenCV & TensorFlow**: For plant disease detection via image processing.
* **Pandas**: For data management and manipulation.

## Installation
